## 5. FAQ Section

### Section Headline
**Questions? Answers.**

---

**Q: What tech stack do these templates use?**
All templates are built with Next.js 14 (App Router), Sanity CMS, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. Deployment is optimized for Vercel, but they'll run anywhere Node.js does.

**Q: Can I use these for client projects?**
Absolutely. The single template license covers one commercial project. The bundle license? Unlimited projects. Use them for clients, startups, side hustles—whatever you're building.

**Q: How do updates work?**
When we improve a template (bug fixes, dependency updates, new features), you get access to the updated files. Single templates include 6 months of updates; the bundle includes lifetime updates.

**Q: Is the code actually clean, or is this another "starter template" nightmare?**
We're developers too—we've inherited the spaghetti codebases. Every template is modular, well-commented, and follows conventions you'd actually want on your team. No vendor lock-in, no weird abstractions.

**Q: Do I need to know Sanity CMS?**
Helps, but not required. We include documentation, pre-built schemas, and the setup is straightforward. If you can use a CMS, you can use Sanity. And if you hate it, rip it out—the templates work without it too.

**Q: What if the template doesn't work for my project?**
You've got 14 days to decide. If it's not the right fit, email us and we'll refund you—no bureaucracy. We want you building, not regretting.

**Q: Do you offer support?**
Bundle buyers get priority support in our Discord. Single template buyers get community access. We're around, we answer questions, and we don't ghost.

**Q: Will there be more templates?**
Yes. We're actively building. Bundle buyers get every new template automatically—no upsells, no "premium packs."
