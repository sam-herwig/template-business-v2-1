# Local Business Website Template Market Research

*Research compiled January 30, 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

**The Opportunity:** 27% of US small businesses still don't have a website. Of those that do, many use outdated or generic templates. Local service businesses (restaurants, contractors, salons, gyms) have specific needs that generic templates don't address well.

**Market Size:**
- Website template market: **$1.3B** (2023), growing 7.5% annually → **$2.2B by 2028**
- 45% of small businesses use templates as their primary solution
- Templates save businesses **50-70%** vs custom development

**Key Insight:** Local businesses need industry-specific features (booking, menus, quote forms) but most templates are generic. There's a gap between cheap generic templates ($17-40) and expensive custom development ($2,000-$9,000).

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Target Customers

**Primary:** Small business owners who:
- Currently have no website or an outdated one
- Can't afford $2K+ custom development
- Don't have time to learn Squarespace/Wix from scratch
- Need industry-specific features (booking, menus, quotes)

**Secondary:** Web designers/agencies who:
- Build sites for local businesses
- Want quality starting points
- Need faster turnaround

### Channels

1. **SEO/Content**
   - "Restaurant website template"
   - "Contractor website builder"
   - "Salon website with booking"
   - Comparison posts: "Best templates for [industry]"

2. **Paid Ads**
   - Google Ads: Industry + template keywords
   - Facebook/Instagram: Target small business owners by industry

3. **Partnerships**
   - Booking software companies (Fresha, Vagaro, etc.)
   - POS companies (Toast, Square)
   - Local business associations

4. **Product Hunt / AppSumo**
   - Launch bundle for early traction

---

## Recommendations

### Build Order (Priority)

1. **Restaurant Template** — Largest pain point (bad websites = lost customers), clear feature set, high search volume

2. **Contractor Template** — Huge market (3.8M businesses), underserved by current templates, quote forms are critical

3. **Salon Template** — Strong demand for booking integration, clear differentiation opportunity

4. **Gym/Fitness Template** — More complex (schedule integration), smaller but growing market

### Differentiation

Our templates should beat ThemeForest on:
- **Industry-specific sections** (not generic "services")
- **Pre-built integrations** (booking, ordering, forms)
- **One-click deploy** (Vercel, not WordPress setup)
- **Video tutorials** (hand-holding for non-technical users)
- **Mobile-first** (most searches are mobile)

### Success Metrics

- **Revenue target:** $5K-10K/month within 6 months
- **Conversion rate:** 2-3% (industry standard for templates)
- **Traffic needed:** ~5,000 monthly visitors to landing page
- **Price × Volume:**
  - 100 sales × $79 avg = $7,900/month
  - Achievable with good SEO + launch momentum
